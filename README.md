# DDoS Mitigation and Anti-Scan Filtering with eBPF and XDP

This repository provides a summarized technical overview of a project that implements **DDoS mitigation** and **port-scan detection** using **eBPF** and **XDP**.  
The work demonstrates how programmable packet processing in the Linux kernel can serve as an efficient first line of defense against volumetric attacks and reconnaissance activities.

The detailed report can be found in the repo.
